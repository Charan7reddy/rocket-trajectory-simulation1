Rocket Trajectory Simulation
Project Overview
This project simulates the vertical trajectory of a rocket launched from the Earth's surface. The simulation models the rocket's motion considering the effects of gravity and optional air resistance (drag force). The resulting trajectory is visualized through a plot that shows the rocket's height over time.

Key Features
Physics-Based Simulation: The simulation uses fundamental principles of physics to calculate the rocket's height and velocity over time.
Customizable Parameters: Users can adjust the initial velocity and drag coefficient to explore different scenarios and understand their impact on the rocket's flight.
Visualization: The results are presented through a clear and informative plot, making it easy to analyze the rocket's performance.
Libraries Used
NumPy: For numerical computations and array handling.
Matplotlib: For plotting the rocket's trajectory and visualizing the results.
How It Works
Initial Setup: The simulation starts with a defined initial velocity and gravitational force. An optional drag coefficient can be set to simulate the effects of air resistance.
Simulation Loop: The trajectory is calculated in small time steps, updating the rocket's velocity and height based on the forces acting on it.
Plotting Results: The final trajectory is plotted, showing how the rocket's height changes over time.
Applications
This project serves as a basic introduction to the concepts of rocket science and physics simulations. It can be extended to include more complex factors such as varying gravitational forces, multi-stage rockets, or non-vertical launches. It is particularly useful for students and enthusiasts in aerospace engineering and physics.

Usage
Clone the repository, run the Jupyter Notebook, and modify the initial conditions to see how different parameters affect the rocket's flight. The notebook is designed to be easily understood and modified, making it an excellent tool for learning and experimentation.
