# rocket-trajectory-simulation1
Simulate the trajectory of a rocket launched vertically with initial velocity. The key factors to consider are:  Initial velocity ( 𝑣 0 v  0 ​  ) Launch angle (assuming vertical launch here for simplicity) Gravity ( 𝑔 g) Drag force (optional for simplicity, can be ignored or added for more complexity)
